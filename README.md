# BZMakeMap
GUI wrapper of the command line tools makeTRN and the Battlezone editor.

A version was originally written years ago in C++ and using OpenFrameworks. Yeah. A bit overkill. I was still a newbie to programming.

Anyway, I thought I had lost the source code, but I found it recently. Lets just say my code was terrifying. 
So, I decided to rewrite it, and since I needed some more Java on my Github, I decided to write it in Java. 

And this is the result!

Currently, it has about 80% feature parity as the original version. Maybe 50% if you include "prettiness".
I'll bring it up to 100% and then we'll see if I decide to add more features from there.
